# Basic-JavaScript-Projects

These are my basic javascript projects that I created to understand Javascript to it's full potential.
Most of them I saw on YouTube and tried by my own.
I enjoyed the time I spent learning JavaScript.
Anyways, I'm pretty good in JS now and heading towards BackEnd things.
Wish me Luck.

And dont tell me to share about how you liked my projects.
Also feel free to use my code for Your purpose.
